dungeonmasters.io
dungeonmasters.io is a fast-paced, multiplayer browser-based .io battle royale game set in a massive circular arena divided into 12 unique clock-like zones. Players battle each other and AI-controlled bots, collect randomized weapons and power-ups from chests, and survive a deadly toxic fog that closes in — all to be the last one standing.

Features
Massive Circular Arena: The huge map’s diameter takes around 3 minutes to cross on foot, divided into 12 distinct zones each with unique layouts, enemies, and loot.

Slanted Isometric Perspective: Inspired by Brawl Stars, with dynamic line-of-sight visibility inside buildings (only near windows and doorways).

Dynamic Toxic Fog: A swirling green cloud appears 1 minute into the game, moves at half player speed, deals damage over time, and instantly kills non-player bots.

Diverse Weapons & Items: Randomized weapon drops in chests ranging from common to mythic rarity, including melee, ranged, bombs, and special power-ups.

Inventory System: Players carry up to 5 items with intuitive number-key swapping, equipping, and dropping.

Guardian Bots & Bosses: AI bots guard high-tier chests and roam zones, providing PvE challenges alongside PvP combat.

Map & HUD: Clickable minimap showing your location and zones, without revealing other players or bots.

Multiplayer PvP: Smooth WASD/arrow keys movement with mouse aiming and shooting in last-player-standing battle royale mode.

Start & End Screens: Start button triggers countdown; after death, placement is displayed with an option to play again.

Monetization Strategy
To generate revenue while keeping gameplay fair and fun, consider these approaches:

1. Cosmetic Purchases
Sell unique player and vehicle skins, weapon skins, emotes, and visual effects.

Cosmetics purely change appearance and do not affect gameplay balance.

Use virtual currency earned in-game or purchased with real money.

2. Premium Chests & Loot Boxes
Offer purchasable premium chests with exclusive weapons, power-ups, or cosmetics.

Ensure core gameplay items are available via regular play to avoid pay-to-win issues.

Limit premium loot mostly to cosmetic or slightly enhanced balanced items.

3. Battle Pass / Seasonal Content
Introduce seasonal Battle Passes offering exclusive cosmetic rewards and boosts.

Free and paid tiers keep players engaged and motivated.

4. Optional Advertisements
Use rewarded ads for players to gain small bonuses (coins, boosts) voluntarily.

Avoid intrusive or mandatory ads to maintain user experience.

5. Support & Donations
Provide a way for players to support development via donations or “tips.”

Reward supporters with special badges or cosmetic flair.
